Usage: vsixsigntool verify [options] <filename(s)>                           
                                                                             
Use the "verify" command to validate embedded signatures. Verification       
determines if the given opc based file has been modified after it was        
signed, signing certificate was issued by a trusted party, whether that      
certificate has been revoked, and whether the certificate is valid under a   
specific policy. Options allow you to specify requirements that must be met  
and to specify how to find the certificate, if appropriate.                  
                                                                             
Currently VsixSignTool supports only default signing policy, which is:       
  - Verify that all parts and relationships part including root              
      relationships part, signature origin part and signature origin         
      relationships part are signed.                                         
  - Only one signature is allowed i.e. package will be considered invalid    
      if there are more than one signatures present in the package.          
                                                                             
Certificate selection options:                                               
/f <file>   Specify the signing cert in a file. If this file is a PFX with   
            a password, the password may be supplied with the "/p" option.   
            If the file is P7B file, use the "/csp" and "/k" options to      
            specify the CSP and container name of the private key.           
            If there is an existing signing cert stored in the package, the  
            stored cert is ignored.                                          
/p <pass.>  Specify a password to use when opening the PFX file.             
/sha1 <h>   Specify the SHA1 hash of the signing cert.                       
                                                                             
Private Key selection options:                                               
/csp <name> Specify the CSP containing the Private Key Container.            
/k <name>   Specify the Key Container Name of the Private Key.               
                                                                             
Other options:                                                               
/q          No output on success and minimal output on failure. As always,   
            VsixSignTool returns 0 on success and 1 on failure.              
/v          Print verbose success and status messages. This may also provide 
            slightly more information on error. If you want to see           
            information about the signer, you should use this option.
