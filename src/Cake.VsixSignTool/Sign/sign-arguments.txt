Usage: vsixsigntool sign [options] <filename(s)>                              
                                                                              
Use the "sign" command to sign files using embedded signatures. Signing       
protects an OPC based file from tampering, and allows users to verify the     
signer (you) based on a signing certificate. The options below allow you to   
 specify signing parameters and to select the signing certificate you wish    
to use.                                                                       
                                                                              
Currently VsixSignTool supports only default signing policy, which is -       
  - Sign all parts and relationships part including root relationships part,  
      signature origin part and signature origin relationships part.          
  - Only one signature is allowed i.e. all previous signatures present in     
      package will be deleted before signing.                                 
                                                                              
                                                                              
Certificate selection options:                                                
/f <file>   Specify the signing cert in a file. If this file is a PFX with    
            a password, the password may be supplied with the "/p" option.    
            If the file is P7B file, use the "/csp" and "/k" options to       
            specify the CSP and container name of the private key.            
              This option is mandatory.                                       
/p <pass.>  Specify a password to use when opening the PFX file.              
/u <usage>  Specify the Enhanced Key Usage that must be present in the cert.  
            The parameter may be specified by OID or by string. The default   
            usage is "Code Signing" (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.3).                      
              (This functionality has not been implemented yet.)              
/sha1 <h>   Specify the SHA1 hash of the signing cert.                        
                                                                              
                                                                              
Private Key selection options:                                                
/csp <name> Specify the CSP containing the Private Key Container.             
/k <name>   Specify the Key Container Name of the Private Key.                
                                                                              
Signing parameter options:                                                    
/es         Embed the signing certificate within the signature part XML.      
            If no "/e." option is specified, "/es" is default.                
/ep         Embed the signing certificate as a separate part in the package.  
/en         Do not embed the signing certificate in either the signature      
            part XML or as a separate part in the package.                    
/cc         Retrieve and embed the certificates in the certificate chain up   
            to the root authority separately in the package.                  
              (This functionality has not been implemented yet.)              
/cn         Do not embed the certificates in the certificate chain            
            separately in the package.                                        
/fd <algo>  file digest algorithm                                             
/t <URL>    Specify the timestamp server's URL. If this option is not         
            present, the signed file will not be timestamped. A warning is    
            generated if timestamping fails.                                  
/tr <URL>   RFC3161_timestamp_URL                                             
/td <algo>  use with /tr switch only
